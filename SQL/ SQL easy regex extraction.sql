/* You'll have a table like the following:

name	greeting
Austin Gaylord	Hola que tal #4702665
Kacie Zulauf	Bienvenido 45454545 tal #470815 BD. WA470815
Output
In this practice you'll need to extract from the greeting column the number preceeded by the # symbol and place it in a new column named user_id.

name	greeting	user_id
Austin Gaylord	Hola que tal #4702665	4702665
Kacie Zulauf	Bienvenido 45454545 tal #470815 BD. WA470815	470815
NOTE: To keep it simple assume that the iser_id will be having varchar type */

SELECT name, greeting, replace(substring(greeting, '#[\d]+'), '#', '') as user_id
FROM greetings;

-- refactor

SELECT
  name,
  greeting,
  SUBSTRING(greeting FROM '#([0-9]+)') AS user_id
FROM greetings;
